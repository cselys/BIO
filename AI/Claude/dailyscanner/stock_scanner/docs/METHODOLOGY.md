# Stock Scanner V1.2 — Methodology & Scoring

## Core Philosophy
`stock_scanner` decouples **trend strength** from **entry attractiveness**. A stock can possess a high trend score but terrible entry location due to overextension; separating these dimensions ensures robust candidate ranking.

## 1. Score Definitions

### Trend Score (0–100)
Measures long-term and intermediate trend health.
- **Weights**:
  - Weekly Trend: 25%
  - Daily Trend: 25%
  - Momentum: 15%
  - Relative Strength: 15%
  - Volume: 10%
  - Structure: 10%
- *Note*: Trend Score measures trend strength, not entry location.

### Bottom Score (0–100)
Evaluates evidence of base formation and stabilization after a significant decline (requires structural stabilization, higher lows, and RSI/MACD recovery).

### Reversal Score (0–100)
Evaluates transition from downtrend to recovery (prior downtrend, higher low, EMA20 reclaim, positive slope, and RSI/MACD improvement).

### Entry Quality (0–100)
Independent score evaluating price location relative to moving averages (EMA20/EMA50 distance), ATR % volatility health, and breakout volume. Punishes extreme overextension (>10% above EMA20).

### Candidate Score (0–100)
The final weighted ranking composite:
- Trend Score: 45%
- Entry Quality: 30%
- Relative Strength: 15%
- State Quality: 10%

## 3. Weekly Candle Treatment
- Resamples daily OHLCV into Friday-ending weekly bars (`W-FRI`).
- Strictly enforces `drop_partial=True` in historical evaluations to drop incomplete current weeks, preventing lookahead bias.
